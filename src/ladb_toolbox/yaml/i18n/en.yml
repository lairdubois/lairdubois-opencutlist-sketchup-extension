      auto_orient_help: |
        If this option is enabled, the 3 dimensions of a part are sorted such that the largest represents the *length* and the smallest represents the *thickness*.

        Otherwise, the local axes of the object define the dimensions as:
         - *length* on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis
         - *width* on the <span style='color:green'>green</span> axis
         - *thickness* on the <span style='color:blue'>blue</span> axis

      smart_material_help: If this option is enabled, parts without defined material may be assigned the material assigned to one of their parent or child.
