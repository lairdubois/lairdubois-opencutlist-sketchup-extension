      name: Description
      material: Material
      cumulable: Summable
      cumulable_help: |
        If this option is selected, the **length** or the **width** will be considered **unit length** or **unit width** multiplied by the count when sorting the parts list.

        <i class='ladb-opencutlist-icon-warning'></i> *This option will not be considered when this part is grouped with other identical parts.*
      cumulable_0: Not summable
      cumulable_1: Summable over length
      cumulable_2: Summable over width
      size_increase: Oversizes
      size_increase_help: |
        Oversizes allow you to increase the dimensions of a single part.
        (*Example : Oversize for a baseboard or a scribe molding that need to be adjusted when installing.*)
      length_increase: Length Oversize
      length_increase_help: Oversize is applied to the real length to define the **raw length**.
      width_increase: Width Oversize
      width_increase_help: Oversize is applied to the real width to define the **raw width**.
      thickness_increase: Thickness Oversize
      thickness_increase_help: Oversize is applied to the real thickness to define the **raw thickness**.
      orientation: Orientation
      orientation_locked_on_axis: Lock orientation on axes
      orientation_locked_on_axis_help: |
        If this option is selected, the option *Automatic orientation of parts* will have no effect on this part,

        hence, in the local coordinate system:
        - *length* is on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis
        - *width* is on the <span style='color:green'>green</span> axis
        - *thickness* is on the <span style='color:blue'>blue</span> axis
      labels: Labels
      labels_help: |
        With *Labels* you can add keywords to customize the part definitions.
        You can add as many labels as you see fit.
        The visible parts of your custlist can then be filtered according to the label list.
      labels_multiple_info: Only common labels are shown
      axes: Axes
      axes_help: Arrange the dimensions so they match the axes colors of your part.
      axes_tip: |
        Note that if the option *Automatic orientation of parts* is not active or the part is *locked on its axes* then:
         - the **length** is read on the <strong style='color:red'>red</strong> axes,
         - the **width** is read on the <strong style='color:green'>green</strong> axes and
         - the **thickness** is read on the <strong style='color:blue'>blue</strong> axes.
      axes_origin_position_none: Do not change the origin
      axes_origin_position_min: Place the origin at a corner
      axes_origin_position_center: Place the origin at the center
      axes_origin_position_min_center: Place the origin in the middle of a face
      over_length: Across the length
      over_width: Across the width
      edge_disabled_help: This edge banding is not configurable because no face has been detected that could carry edge banding material in the model.
      multiple_values: Multiple values
    option:
      auto_orient: Automatic orientation of parts
      auto_orient_help: |
        If this option is selected, the 3 dimensions of a part are sorted such that the largest represents the *length* and the smallest represents the *thickness*.

        If this option is left unselected, the local axes of the part define the dimensions as follows
         - *length* is on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis
         - *width* is on the <span style='color:green'>green</span> axis
         - *thickness* is on the <span style='color:blue'>blue</span> axis
      smart_material: "*Smart* assignment of material"
      smart_material_help: If this option is selected, parts without defined material may be assigned the material assigned to one of their parent or child.
      dynamic_attributes_name: Use the attribute *Name* of dynamic components
      dynamic_attributes_name_help: |
        If this option is selected, the designation of parts will be extracted from the attribute *Name*, if defined.

        <i class='ladb-opencutlist-icon-warning'></i> Instances of parts with the same definition will be separated if the attribute *Name* does not have the same value.
      part_number_with_letters: Use letters to enumerate parts
      part_number_with_letters_help: If this option is selected, parts are enumerated using letters (A, B, C, ... Z, AA, AB, ...).
      part_number_sequence_by_group: Reinitialize the enumeration of parts for each group
      part_number_sequence_by_group_help: If this option is selected, the enumeration of parts is reinitialized to 1 (or A) for each group of same material type and thickness.
      part_folding: Group identical parts
      part_folding_help: If this option is selected, parts with **identical size** and with **identical labels** will be grouped.
      hide_entity_names: Hide instance names
      hide_entity_names_help: If this option is selected, **instance names** of parts will not be displayed.
      hide_labels: Hide labels
      hide_labels_help: If this option is selected, **labels** will be hidden.
      hide_cutting_dimensions: Hide rough dimensions
      hide_cutting_dimensions_help: If this option is selected, the **rough** dimensions of parts will be hidden.
      hide_bbox_dimensions: Hide finished dimensions
      hide_bbox_dimensions_help: If this option is selected, the **finished** dimensions of parts will be hidden.
      hide_untyped_material_dimensions: Hide the dimensions for parts with undefined material type
      hide_untyped_material_dimensions_help: If this option is selected, the dimensions of parts with an undefined material type (not **Solid Wood**, **Sheet Good** or **Dimensional**) will be hidden.
      hide_final_areas: Hide actual area of parts of type *Sheet Good*
      hide_final_areas_help: If this option is selected, the **actual areas** of parts of type *Sheet Good* will be hidden.
      hide_edges: Hide the column of edge bandings
      hide_edges_help: If this option is selected, the **edge banding columns** of parts of type *Sheet Good* will be hidden.
      minimize_on_highlight: Mimimize after *'$t(tab.cutlist.highlight_part)...'*
      minimize_on_highlight_help: If this option is selected, the OpenCutList window will be minimized when the function *'$t(tab.cutlist.highlight_part)'* is applied.
