      name: Description
      material: Material
      cumulable: Summable
      cumulable_help: |
        If this option is selected, the **length** or the **width** will be considered **unit length** or **unit width** multiplied by the count when sorting the parts list.
      cumulable_0: Not summable
      cumulable_1: Summable over length
      cumulable_2: Summable over width
      instance_count_by_part: Packaging
      instance_count_by_part_help: |
        Allows the part to be considered as a *package* of one or more *items*.
        The quantity associated with the part in the parts list will therefore represent the number of whole packages needed to obtain the number of items actually present in the model.

        *Example: To count only 1 part for a pair of drawer runners:
        Packaging = 2 units / part*
      instance_count_by_part_1: 1 unit per part
      instance_count_by_part_2: 2 units per part
      mass: Weight
      mass_help: The weight of the part will be used when generating **Reports**.
      price: Price
      price_help: The price of the part will be used when generating **Reports**.
      tags: Tags
      tags_help: |
        *Tags* are custom keywords that can be added to each part definition.
        You can add as many tags as you want.
        The visible parts of your parts list can then be filtered against these tags.
      tags_multiple_info: Only common tags are displayed
      orientation: Orientation
      orientation_locked_on_axis: Lock orientation on axes
      orientation_locked_on_axis_help: |
        If this option is selected, the option *Automatic orientation of parts* will have no effect on this part

        Hence, in the local coordinate system:
        - *length* is on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis,
        - *width* on the <span style='color:green'>green</span> axis and
        - *thickness* on the <span style='color:blue'>blue</span> axis
      symmetrical: Disable mirrored part detection on this part
      symmetrical_help: |
        If this box is checked, the detection of a *mirrored part* will have no effect on the part.
      ignore_grain_direction: Ignore grain direction on this part
      ignore_grain_direction_help: |
        If this box is checked, the grain direction of the material will be ignored for this part.
      size_increase: Oversizes
      size_increase_help: |
        Oversizes increase the dimensions of a single part.
        (*Example: Oversize for a baseboard or a scribe molding that should be adjusted at assembly.*)
      length_increase: Length Oversize
      length_increase_help: Oversize is applied to the final length to define the **raw length**.
      width_increase: Width Oversize
      width_increase_help: Oversize is applied to the final width to define the **raw width**.
      thickness_increase: Thickness Oversize
      thickness_increase_help: Oversize is applied to the final thickness to define the **raw thickness**.
      axes: Axes
      axes_help: Reorder the dimensions to match the desired axis colors in your part.
      axes_tip: |
        Note that if the option *Automatic orientation of parts* is not active or the part is *locked on its axes* then:
         - the **length** is read on the <strong style='color:red'>red</strong> axis,
         - the **width** on the <strong style='color:green'>green</strong> axis and
         - the **thickness** on the <strong style='color:blue'>blue</strong> axis.
      axes_origin_position_none: Do not change the origin
      axes_origin_position_min: Place the origin at a corner
      axes_origin_position_center: Place the origin at the center
      axes_origin_position_min_center: Place the origin in the middle of a face
      over_length: Across the length
      over_width: Across the width
      edge_disabled_help: This edge banding is not configurable because no material-bearing face has been detected on this edge of the part in the model.
      multiple_values: Multiple values

    option:
      auto_orient: Automatic orientation of parts
      auto_orient_help: |
        If this option is selected, the 3 dimensions of the parts are sorted so that the largest value represents the *length* and the smallest the *thickness*.

        Otherwise,
         - the *length* is read on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis,
         - the *width* on the <span style='color:green'>green</span> axis and
         - the *thickness* on the <span style='color:blue'>blue</span> axis
      smart_material: "*Smart* assignment of material"
      smart_material_help: "If this option is selected, parts without defined material may be assigned the material assigned to one of their parent or child."
      dynamic_attributes_name: Use the attribute *Name* of dynamic components
      dynamic_attributes_name_help: |
        If this option is selected, the designation of parts will be extracted from the attribute *Name*, if defined.

        <i class='ladb-opencutlist-icon-warning'></i> Instances of parts with the same definition will be separated if the attribute *Name* does not have the same value.
      part_number_with_letters: Use letters to enumerate parts
